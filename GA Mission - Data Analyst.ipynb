The current problem faced by the IT team is that the reports created by CMS do not answer all the questions they have about the computers in their environment. Luckily, they figured out that the CMS stores its raw data in a SQLite (v3.45.0)  _database (DB)_ file and that they could write custom SQL queries to report the information not provided within the CMS reports.\n\n## Goal:\nYour job will be to update this Jupyter Notebook with the SQL queries needed to meet the IT team’s reporting needs. It is recommended to use a Database IDE to help with query writing and data exploration.\n\n## Directions:\nDownload the attached zip file which contains all the files you need to complete this assignment. Below is a description of each of the three files within the attached zip file:\n- **cms.sqlite**: The database you must query from to complete this assignment.\n- **cms_data_dictionary.txt**: A data dictionary describing the tables within this database.\n- **GA Mission - Data Analyst.ipynb**: The Jupyter Notebook file you must update to complete the assignment. Rules to abide by while completing this assignment are listed within this Jupyter Notebook.\n\n## Our Expectations\nThis assignment <ins>**should take you no longer than 2 hours**</ins> to complete. Make sure your outputs are visible in a web browser when uploaded to a public repository and that they are presented in a way that is understandable by someone with some technical experience but no programming experience. Extra rules to abide by are described in the included Juptyter Notebook file.\n\nWe would prefer that you share the code with us by pushing it to a public repository in the hosting provider of your choosing. If you do not want to upload it to a public repository then you can zip up the repository folder on your machine and send it to us via email. If you go that route, please make sure that the .git folder is included.\n\nWe recommend  that you use a Database IDE (e.g., DBeaver, Datagrip, etc.) to assist with query writing and data exploration. If you have any questions, please contact us and we will do our best to clarify anything that is unclear.\n\n## Rules:\n- The code should be stored in a git repository.\n- With the exception of ***Pandas***, you can use any Python Packages you like.\n- Do not edit the data in the **cms.sqlite** DB file.\n- Your query results must be output in a _Pandas DataFrame (PD)_.\n- Questions 4 and 5 are written answer questions where no code or SQL is necessary.\n- Question 6 is a written answer question that may require code or SQL depending on your answer. This question can be thought of as a chance to share any observations you've made or perform a light EDA on the data. There are no right or wrong answers for this question.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Questions","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import pandas as pd\nimport sqlite3 as db\n\nconn = db.connect(\"/kaggle/input/galacticsolutionsmission/cms.sqlite\")\ncur = conn.cursor()","metadata":{"collapsed":false,"ExecuteTime":{"end_time":"2024-06-17T13:55:05.522484Z","start_time":"2024-06-17T13:55:05.517488Z"},"jupyter":{"outputs_hidden":false},"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-06-28T15:39:56.285212Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-06-28T15:39:56.285930Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-06-28T15:39:56.303950Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-06-28T15:39:56.285877Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-06-28T15:39:56.301555Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":15,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":" <font size='5'>1.

Normally you do want to reduce unnecessary joins.\n\nNormally in my experience this is what I would have Bob look into. \n\nOne of the things I know from experience is selecting the necessary comlumns across all joins is crucial. Specially when dealing with multiple tables of over 500k records if you're just selecting * it takes a big hit. Select necessary fields across all joins and that should help out a bit. \n\nOveruse of Group BY is a problem too at a big scale.

As an analyst I expect this, but if say a data architect were to see this they would want a framework to define these fields better. \n\n\nLogin Records:\n- assuming all logins are successful, from a monitoring perspective it would be nice to know if these records were attempts or actual logins, another comlumn would be nice\n- I would also add a user foreign key just to make it easier to track. for reporting or analysis purposes it's just faster, I don't think there would be too much technical processing cost to have that relative to the business value it saves later down at my level. \n\nInstalled Programs: \n- I would definitely try to get a better mapping for the program names, I understand why they are the way the are, but that pathing and variation in naming really causes a hassle down the road, it's fine for 'back-end' side if you will, but if more business people come in and consume this they're gonna have a much harder time. In the spirit of my favorite phrase, slow is smooth, smooth is fast. My thought is always beign careful in the beginning and making something that creates speed in the downstream. \n\nIP_Whitelist:\n- I would like a network submask field, and maybe IPV4/IPV6 classification too.
